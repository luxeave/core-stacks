Here’s a **structured markdown guide** based on your Next.js notes, with clear sections, command snippets, and concise explanations for quick reference.

# Next.js Quick Reference Guide

## 1. Routing in Next.js

* **No need for React Router**

  * Next.js includes its own file-based routing system.
  * Just add files in the `/pages` or `/app` directory, and routes are created automatically.

---

## 2. Recommended VSCode Extensions

Install these for an improved developer experience:

* **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native Snippets**
* **JavaScript & TypeScript Nightly**
* **Tailwind CSS Intellisense**

**How to Install:**

1. Open the Extensions sidebar (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
2. Search each extension name and click Install.

---

## 3. Project Setup

### 3.1 Create a Next.js App

```bash
pnpm create next-app@latest some-app
```

* Replace `some-app` with your desired project name.

### 3.2 Install PocketBase

```bash
pnpm install pocketbase --save
```

* Adds [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) as a dependency for backend/database needs.

---

## 4. Productivity Shorthand

* Use `rafce` snippet (from ES7+ Snippets extension) to **scaffold a React component** quickly.

**Example:**

* Type `rafce` in a `.js`/`.tsx` file, press Tab – it generates a React Arrow Function Component template.

## 5. Rendering Modes in Next.js

### 5.1 CSR: Client-Side Rendering

* **Where?** Runs in the browser.
* **Pros:** Full interactivity.
* **Cons:**

  * Large JS bundles
  * More resource intensive on the client
  * Poor SEO
  * Less secure (code exposed to browser)

### 5.2 SSR: Server-Side Rendering

* **Where?** Runs on the server before sending HTML to the browser.
* **Pros:** Good for SEO, smaller client bundle, more secure.
* **Cons:**

  * No direct interactivity (needs hydration for client interactivity)
  * State not automatically persisted between requests
  * Requires careful use of React hooks like `useEffect`

## 6. Quick Comparison: CSR vs SSR

| Feature       | CSR                            | SSR                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Where Runs    | Browser (client)               | Server (before page loads) |
| SEO           | Poor                           | Good                       |
| Interactivity | Full (default React style)     | Needs hydration            |
| Performance   | Heavy on client, large bundles | Faster initial load        |
| Security      | Exposes logic to browser       | Safer, less code exposed   |

## 7. Essential Notes

* **Next.js handles routing internally**—no need for external routers.
* For backend/database needs, you can integrate libraries like **PocketBase**.
* For fast scaffolding, learn and use snippets like `rafce`.
